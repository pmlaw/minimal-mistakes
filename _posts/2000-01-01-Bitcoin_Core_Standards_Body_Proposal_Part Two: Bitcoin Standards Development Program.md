##Part Two: Bitcoin Standards Development Program

###5. Bitcoin Standards Development Program

####5.1. Organizational Structure

The organizational structure of the BSDP would include, but not be limited to:

* **The Bitcoin Foundation**, which would provide the legal and financial framework. While the Foundation may have a representative Participant in the Standards Program, and therefore have a single vote in the process, the Foundation has no additional technical control or influence over which ideas are considered and progressed through Standards Program.
* **Bicameral Decision-Making Model**, consisting of the Working Group and the Steering Group. These groups would operate as separate decision-making bodies in consideration of a Proposal tracking through the Standards Program. All Participants would have full access as a Working Group Participant, unless there were multiple Participants from one employer, as discussed in greater detail below (see Bitcoin Standards Working Group Participant). However, only a select group would make up the Steering Group, which is a nine (9) person body elected by and from the Participants. The Steering Group has the final vote on a Last Call Proposal, and thus are the gatekeepers regarding what becomes an Adopted Standard. Any Participant may be elected to the Steering Group. 
* **Bitcoin Steering Group**, consisting of nine (9) Participants elected annually by and from the Participants. Steering Group Participants may serve indefinite successive terms. Only one representative per company would be allowed to hold a seat on the Steering Group at a given time. The responsibilities of the Steering Group would include considering whether a Last Call Proposal should become an Adopted Standard; identifying gaps in Standards in an effort to invite innovation; voting on the formation or dissolution of working groups; and electing the Working Group Chair.
* **Bitcoin Standards Working Group**, would be the primary working body of the Standards Program, comprised of anyone who accepts the terms of the Participation Agreement. Each Participant would have wholly equal rights and access to the Working Group, except as described above (see Bitcoin Standards Working Group Participant). The focused responsibilities of the Working Group would be to consider, discuss, and debate a Proposal that has been submitted to the Working Group.
* **Bitcoin Standards Working Group Participant**, which would include any individual who accepts the terms of the Participation Agreement. Each participant would be entitled to one vote. If an individual is employed by a company with a material interest in Bitcoin Standards, as determined by the majority vote of the Appeals Board, that individual would be deemed to be a Working Group Participant on behalf of that employer. Furthermore, in order to ensure a level playing field and minimize unfair commercial interests, a company with a material interest in Bitcoin Standards, as determined by the majority vote of the Appeals Board, would be entitled to only one vote. In other words, as a hypothetical, ABC Bitcoin Wallets, Inc. may have multiple employees serve as Participants in the Working Group, but only one Participant could be designated by the employer as the Primary Participant to cast the one vote to which that company is entitled. Furthermore, if Joe Smith is an employee of ABC Bitcoin Wallets, Inc., he would be presumed to be a Participant on behalf of his employer.
* **Proposal Author**, which would be the owner, steward, draftsman, and champion of an idea and proposal as it is developed, evolved, and shepherded throughout the decision-making lifecycle. As a Proposal is progressing, Participants discuss and suggest changes on the Working Group's mailing list; a Proposal Author is expected to follow the discussion and make changes when there is rough consensus. The Proposal Author is responsible for ensuring that the contents of the document accurately reflect Working Group decisions. Two Participants may be Co-Proposal Author, so long as one is identified as Primary.
* **Chief & Associate Proposal Editor.** At any given time there would be a Chief Proposal Editor and an Associate Proposal Editor. These individuals would be elected by and from the Working Group Participants. Each would be elected to two-year staggered terms where the first year of the term would be served as the Associate Proposal Editor and the second year would be served as the Chief Proposal Editor. These individuals would serve a gating role for submission of a Proposal to the Working Group for consideration.  They would evaluate, among other things, whether an idea has been sufficiently vetted and whether it complies with formatting requirements. The duties would rest primarily with the Chief Proposal Editor with the Associate Proposal Editor taking on these duties in the Chief Proposal Editor’s absence.
* **Appeals Board**, which would be responsible for reviewing challenges to the administration of the processes. It would be comprised of seven (7) individuals elected annually by and from the Working Group with two year-term limits. Only one representative per company would be allowed to hold a seat on the Appeals Board at a given time.
* **Secretariat Team**, which would administer and manage the day-to-day operations and logistics of the BSDP.

####5.2. The Bitcoin Standards Working Group

The primary working body of the BSDP would be the Bitcoin Standards Working Group. The existing Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process would serve as a foundation upon which to build. Beyond that, the Bitcoin Standards Working Group would be formed in the image of an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Working Group, meaning that it would generally incorporate many of the processes already established for an IETF Working Group.

The responsibilities of the Bitcoin Standards Working Group would include, but not be limited to, the following:

* Developing an initial idea from a Draft Proposal through the process to an Adopted Standard;
* Managing the Standard Review Process;
* Finalizing and publishing Version 1.0 of the Standard(s);
* Evolving the Standard(s) as necessary, whether to correct for minor clerical issues or major issues (i.e., security vulnerabilities, new functionalities, etc.);
* Publishing the Standard(s) and subsequent versions; and
* Liaising with the Testing Program to ensure that the Standard is appropriately tested.

####5.3. Participation

Participation in the Bitcoin Standards Working Group would be open to anyone, whether an individual or a company, via an online click-through agreement. The “Participation Agreement” would be binding on all who sign, to each other, subject to withdrawal or termination. There would be Annual Fees administered on a sliding scale where individuals would pay lower Annual Fees, and companies would pay an increased amount. 

The goal is to avoid a pay-to-play ecosystem and to create an even playing field between individuals and corporate/commercial interests such that an individual would be equally enabled to meaningfully contribute to the adoption and evolution of Bitcoin Standards. There would also be no requirement that members be a part of The Bitcoin Foundation.

####5.4. Process and Procedures

An overarching goal of the Bitcoin Standards Development Program is to **enable the Bitcoin ecosystem to find consensus and engage in permissionless innovation.**

“Permissionless innovation” is meant to convey the ability of innovators to create a product without first conforming to the arbitrarily established requirements of a standards program that is out of touch with cutting edge innovation. To foster the desire for permissionless innovation, the processes of the Bitcoin Standards Working Group should allow for the establishment of trailing and descriptive standards, as opposed to leading and proscriptive standards. In other words, a standard should not be adopted by the Bitcoin Standards Working Group until there is consensus regarding demonstrated successful field implementations. Once this is demonstrated, it can be described and formally adopted as a standard for Bitcoin. The standard should “trail” and “describe” what is already taking place in the ecosystem, as opposed to “leading” the way and arbitrarily “proscribing” requirements to which the ecosystem must conform. This is an important value to the stakeholders and thus should be formally incorporated into the processes.

On balance, Participants should also have a mechanism by which they can collaborate on emerging technologies in response to a strategic roadmap identifying gaps in the protocol and inviting innovation to address those gaps. The Steering Group would be empowered to identify and request innovation to address gaps in the protocol. As outlined further below, an Experimental Proposal can be submitted to the decision-making body to collaborate on emerging innovations before they would necessarily be considered as an Adopted Standard. The adopted processes should also be clear and transparent, including established timelines, so that those who seek to introduce a new idea can understand the process and see a clear path to follow. The process rules should also make gamesmanship as difficult to engage in as possible.

These fundamental guiding principles should be incorporated into a process that is (a) an evolution of the BIPs process, to include the addition of an IPR Policy, and (b) a process that could feasibly be maintained and transitioned if the Bitcoin Standards Working Group should ever seek formal recognition as an official IETF Working Group in the future, and (c) produces a standard and defined schedule for evolution of that standard which can be the subject of an associated Testing and Branding Program.

The actual process for development and maintenance of a standard to be adopted by the Bitcoin Standards Working Group will be developed in greater details during Phase 2 of this proposal, but for now, at a high-level, the process will address all aspects of decision making and collaboration, including the following:

* **Decision-Making.**  Decision-making would be conducted primarily in the first instance by rough consensus, meaning that whether the Working Group approves an idea, whether competing concepts within a proposal, or an entire proposal itself, will be based on the rough consensus of the Working Group. Unlike the objective action of taking an official vote, this is a subjective determination made at the discretion of the Author and/or the Working Group Chair. Challenges to the determination that a particular idea has received rough consensus may either be appealed to the Appeals Board. When voting takes place, votes may be cast in person or online and may only be conducted once sufficient notice of a vote has been provided to all voting participants. 
* **Appeals.** An appeals process would be in place wherein a Working Group Participant could challenge a decision or administration of the established processes. For example, if a Working Group Participant asserts that a dissenting opinion was not appropriately considered, the Working Group Participant could appeal that decision to the Appeals Board. 
* **Timelines and Deadlines.** To ensure a timely, predictable, efficient, and transparent process, timelines and deadlines will be required. Consequences for failure to meet timelines and deadlines will also be addressed. Care must be taken to balance the need for speed with process. For example, there is a balance to strike between whether or not all dissenting comments must be reconciled and how long a discussion phase will remain open, since each step in the process adds to the duration of the decision-making life-cycle.  
* **Evolution of the Standard.** In order to be able to test to the adopted standards, there must be an established timeline for revising, evolving, and publishing updated versions of adopted standards. This will be key to developers to ensure that they can develop to the most current version and anticipate when subsequent versions will be published.
* **Communication & Collaboration.** Three face-to-face meetings per year are recommended, with the primary purpose being the maintenance and evolution of adopted standards, although other aspects of the Working Group’s duties could also be conducted during the face-to-face meetings. In the interim, collaboration and communication can be web-based, including email and group conferencing platforms (e.g. Google Hangouts). Administrative support, such as group rosters, calendars, document storage, voting administration, and action items can be conducted via a web-based platform (e.g. Kavi.com). An external facing website will be required in order to, among other things, to offer the click-through “Participation Agreement,” and make the standards available to implementers.
* **Elections.** Certain positions would be elected, including Steering Group Members, Working Group Chair(s), Appeals Board Members, and Chief and Associate Proposal Editors. Elections are conducted by official vote. 
* **Formation and Dissolution of New Working Groups.** The initial Bitcoin Standards Development Program would be comprised of only the Bitcoin Standards Working Group. However, as the program continues, there may be a desire for separate, more focused working group categories. In that case, the process will allow for the formation of new working groups as needed. The process must also provide a method for dissolving working groups that are no longer needed. 
* **Submission Format Requirements.** Certain format requirements would be established for enforcement by the Draft Proposal Editor. 
* **Process Modification.** Modifications to the processes would be made by submitting a Policies and Procedures tracked Draft Proposal to be considered by the Working Group. 
* **Gating Steps and Decision Points.** Various stages of the idea workflow will be defined, including gating for the following decision points:

* **Vetting Pre-requisite.** An idea should be sufficiently vetted before being formally introduced to the Bitcoin Standards Working Group, particularly with respect to ensuring the idea has not been previously addressed and is otherwise ripe for consideration.   

* **Multiple Demonstrated Successful Implementation Requirement.** When vetting a Standards track Proposal, an additional imperative element of vetting would require there to be demonstrated multiple successful implementations before the Proposal may be submitted to the Working Group. This determination would be made at the subjective determination of the Chief Proposal Editor, and the determination could be appealed.   

* **Draft Proposal.** A new idea introduced to the decision-making process should be submitted as a Draft Proposal by an Author. The Draft Proposal would be approved for submission by the Chief Draft Proposal Editor acting in a gatekeeper role. The Chief Draft Proposal Editor would evaluate whether the idea has been satisfactorily vetted, including whether there has been sufficient demonstration of prior successful implementations. Any decision of the Chief Draft Proposal Editor could be appealed to the Appeals Board.   

* **Initial Discussion Phase.** A defined period of time would be permitted for the initial discussion the idea. Progress and resolution of an idea raised during the discussion would be determined based on rough consensus.   

* **Review Proposal.** The Author would be responsible for preparing a Review Proposal, which would be expected to satisfactorily address the points raised during the Initial Discussion Phase.   

* **Review Phase and Vote.** The Working Group would have a defined period of time to review the Review Proposal to evaluate whether it has satisfactorily addressed the points raised during the Initial Discussion Phase. A proposal would not be able to progress to the next stage without approval by a vote of the Working Group.  If the Review Proposal is not approved, it is sent back down for further discussion. A Review Proposal could only be presented to the Working Group twice. If it was not approved during the second phase of consideration, it would not continue further through the process.   

* **Last Call Proposal.** This would be a final proposal where the Author could make final refinements before submission to the Steering Group for their consideration.   

* **Last Call Vote.** A vote of the Steering Group Participants on the Last Call Proposal, which would require approval by Seven (7) of the nine (9) members of the Steering Group.   

* **Adopted Standard.** An approved Last Call Proposal which relates to Bitcoin Standards.   

* **Adopted Process Modification.** An approved Policies and Procedures track proposal approved by the Working Group which relates to the Bitcoin Standards Working Group processes.   

* **Evolution, Revision, or Maintenance Standard.** The Bitcoin Standards Working Group must publish subsequent versions of the standard(s) on an established timeline so that they can become the subject of a testing, certification, and branding program. Whether this critical aspect of the process is conducted by the entire Work Group or a core sub-group will be evaluated during subsequent phases of this program proposal.

####5.5.	Intellectual Property Rights Policy

An IPR Policy must be established for the Bitcoin Standards Working Group. Generally, the IPR Policy would be executed upon becoming a Working Group Participant by acceptance of the click-through Participation Agreement. While the IPR Policy of the IETF was identified as a reasonable model, the IPR Policy here should be stronger and more effectively eliminate loopholes.

The IPR Policy for the Bitcoin Standards Working Group would be crafted with the following goals and objectives:

* Ensure a full non-assert covenant to protect the protocol from patent-related encumbrances;
* Promote widespread implementation of standards;
* Ensure that patented technologies are only included after deliberate consideration of their merits and costs;
* Ensure sufficient incentives for the holders of important technology to participate in and contribute to the standardization process;
* Ensure an equitable distribution of economic benefits of standardization among different types of stakeholders;
* Ensure transparency and certainty relating to which patents claims are essential claims under the standard(s);
* Minimize the potential for bad-faith participants to “game” the system;
* Provide legal rights for good-faith participants to assert in court to defend against bad-faith participants; and
* Avoid unnecessarily burdensome IPR-related processes, both within the Working Group and for the Participants with respect to their respective patent portfolios.
