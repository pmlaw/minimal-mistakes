##Part One: Overall Consideration

###1. Why create a Bitcoin Standards Development Program & a Testing and Branding Program?

One of the fundamental questions to be addressed is whether creating a Bitcoin Standards Development Program (**“BSDP”**) and associated Testing and Branding Program (**“TBP”**) is recommended at all. The answer is a resounding yes, but let us briefly explore why. 

When considering the Bitcoin ecosystem and market as a whole, a considerable inhibitor of market adoption is consumer confidence in security.  Consider the following assessment as outlined in Forbes:

*“…[B]itcoin’s ability to scale further hinges on consumer confidence and the development of services that allow users to securely store and transact in bitcoins.” [^fn-1]*

At a very basic level, the creation of a standards organization enables the market to develop the services with increased confidence that the services will be interoperable and secure, thereby minimizing risk to all. This, in turn, boosts consumer confidence. Adding testing, certification, and branding further validates a standard and thus further increases consumer confidence, ultimately resulting in increased market adoption. Simply put, standards combined with testing, certification, and branding are in the best interests of Bitcoin. 

###2. Mission Statement, Fundamental Values, Vision, and Scope

####2.1. Mission Statement

**Mission Statement:** The Bitcoin Standards Development Program aims to ensure that a single core protocol is universally accepted as the authoritative technology standard for Bitcoin on which all reference implementations are built. 

####2.2. Fundamental Values and Vision

At the very core of Bitcoin are the values of openness, decentralization, transparency, innovation, and a level playing field. The BSDP would uphold these values by providing the market with the following:

* a semiformal, clear process for the proposal, consideration, and adoption and evolution of a standard;
* decentralized decision-making; and
* open access to membership, which would preclude a pay-to-play ecosystem. 

These same fundamental values must remain at the foundation of a Testing and Branding Program. Stakeholder feedback affirms that a Bitcoin Testing and Branding Program must ensure a low barrier for entry to the market and must remain accessible by all, particularly with respect to bias and financial resources. A program that does not take these elements into consideration is not likely to be championed by the Bitcoin community.    

####2.3. Scope

The scope of the BSDP would be focused on the development, evolution, and maintenance of technology standards, but it would not be responsible for marketing or public relations. The durational scope would be indefinite unless or until the work efforts were transitioned to a separate existing standards program. 

####3. Governance 

A relevant model reviewed in preparing this proposal is the governance structure employed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (“IETF”). There, a separate non-profit organization, The Internet Society, provides the legal and financial framework for the IETF, an informal organized activity of The Internet Society. A similar model is recommended here. The work of the BSDP would be an unassociated, organized activity of The Bitcoin Foundation, and fall under the established legal framework of The Bitcoin Foundation. 

While the Bitcoin Standards Working Group would be separate from The Bitcoin Foundation in terms of the technical work, the testing program would be administered by The Bitcoin Foundation. As is described in greater detail below, wallet security testing would be conducted by an independent third party laboratory, and test results would be provided to the Secretariat on behalf of The Bitcoin Foundation.  The Bitcoin Foundation would then issue the actual certification, along with a license to use its trademarks in connection with having satisfactorily passed a certification test.  Testing compliance via tests fests would also be available for other service and product providers in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

Importantly, an independent Secretariat Team would manage the operation of both programs under the oversight of The Bitcoin Foundation.

####4. Stakeholders

At various levels, those who hold a stake in the development, adoption, and evolution of Bitcoin Standards include upstream technology developers, downstream product implementers, product providers, system integrators, service providers, other intermediate users, governments, and, of course, end users. And, of course, meaningful participation in the process must be open equally to all these stakeholders. Moreover, within companies, while the technical professionals will be the obvious front-line participants, the strategic business, marketing, and legal professionals within those companies will also be stakeholders in the overall program. Care must be taken to ensure that the interests of all these stakeholders are incorporated into not only the development of these programs, but also their ongoing administration.
